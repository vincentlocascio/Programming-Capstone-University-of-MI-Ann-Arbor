Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python University of Michigan PageRank Capstone â€“ Project Process Summary

ðŸ—‚ Case Study: PageRank Capstone â€“ Web Crawling, Link Analysis, and Network Visualization Project Overview This project aimed to implement a streamlined version of a search engine backend, replicating the core functionalities of web crawling, index building, and ranking through link analysis. Using a custom Python-based crawler and a SQLite backend, I created a local web index that served as the foundation for computing PageRank values and visualizing page relationships via D3.js.

The capstone project was completed using code provided in pagerank.zip, which I extended and operated across several stages to explore network behavior at small scale and reinforce concepts in graph theory, data mining, and visual analytics.

Objectives:
-Build a persistent web crawler capable of navigating and storing web content from a given starting URL.

-Construct a link graph representing the structure of the crawled domain.

-Apply the PageRank algorithm to evaluate page importance based on link structure.

-Export and visualize the resulting network with attention to node centrality and connectivity.

-Technical Implementation

Crawling & Storage Layer:


The initial phase involved configuring a crawler (spider.py) to traverse and collect content from a web domain (e.g., dr-chuck.com or a portion of Wikipedia). Each retrieved page was parsed for outbound links, and all URL relationships were logged into a SQLite database. The architecture supports resumable crawling sessions and avoids redundant page retrievals.
Key design considerations:

Persistent queueing of unretrieved links.

Page deduplication and retrieval status tracking.

Respect for crawl boundaries to prevent uncontrolled data expansion.

Link Graph Analysis & PageRank Following data acquisition, I used sprank.py to compute PageRank scores for all indexed pages. The algorithm iteratively distributes rank values based on the number and quality of inbound links, with convergence reached after multiple passes over the dataset.
This process mirrors the importance propagation mechanism used in real-world search engines, albeit on a much smaller scale and with simplified damping and edge-weight handling.

Features:

Adjustable iteration depth for convergence tuning.

Reset functionality to restart ranking from uniform distribution.

Efficient in-memory operations due to local data access.

Visualization of Link Topology To interpret the final PageRank scores and link network, I exported the top-ranking pages and their links to JSON using spjson.py. This data was rendered with a D3.js-based force.html visualization, which presented a dynamic graph of the network.
Visualization insights:

Node size represented PageRank magnitude.

Link directionality depicted navigational structure.

Drag-and-drop interaction enhanced exploratory analysis.

Results The project successfully replicated a minimal search engine pipeline from crawl to rank to visualization. The D3.js output clearly illustrated central nodes with high inbound influence and peripheral nodes with minimal connectivity. Link density and circular paths became apparent as the crawler explored denser sites such as Wikipedia.

The PageRank algorithm demonstrated convergence behavior after approximately 20â€“30 iterations on sample datasets. Repeated runs confirmed stability and reproducibility of the computed ranks.

Tools & Technologies Python: core implementation, parsing, and logic.

SQLite: persistent storage of page and link data.

D3.js: force-directed graph visualization.

HTML/JS: front-end rendering for interactive output.

Reflections This project deepened my understanding of search engine architecture, data graph modeling, and the use of algorithms like PageRank for value attribution in networks. While scaled down, the system emulates real-world crawling and ranking logic, providing a strong foundation for further exploration into large-scale data mining, graph analytics, or distributed crawling systems.
